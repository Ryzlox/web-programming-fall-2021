<h1>Adventure Maze Game</h1>

<p>You take the ladder down into the lit space.</p>
<p>As you're climbing down the ladder, the lit space opens up into a lit up mineshaft with no pathways. It seems to be a dead end, so you climb up.</p>
<p>As you're climbing up, the ladder segment above your hand snaps, and you fall from a high height and die.</p>

<p>This was a bad ending! Try again from the start or go back and check out the other endings!</p>
