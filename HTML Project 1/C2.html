<p>You continued forward.</p>
<p>You come to a large grassy area near a pond of water. You can see a hole in one of the walls of the pond, but you also see another pathway that seems to bend around a corner and lead somewhere. </p>
<p>Do you take the pathway or do you try and investigate the hole?</p>
