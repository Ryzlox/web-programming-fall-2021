<h1>Adventure Maze Game</h1>

<p>You took the right path.</p>
<p>You come to a set of rail tracks and an empty minecart. There's also an opening in the wall, but there's a gap in the floor and a long drop down. You'd have to jump to reach it.</p>
<p> Do you take the minecart or do you try and jump for the opening in the wall?</p>
