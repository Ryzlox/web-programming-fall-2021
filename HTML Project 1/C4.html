<p>You take a running start and jump for the hole.</p>
<p>You're able to grasp onto the ledge and pull yourself up. Continuing down this hallway and a spiralling staircase, you come to two large iron doors, guarded by two iron knights.</p>

<p>There is a sign in front of the knights claiming that of the two doors, one leads to freedom, and the other one leads to certain doom. </p>
<p>The sign claims that you can ask one of the knights which door is correct, but one knight lies, and one knight tells the truth. </p>
<p> You decide to ask the left knight what door would the right knight say is correct, and he says that the right door is what the right knight would say is correct.</p>

<p>With this information, which door do you pass through? </p>
