<h1>Adventure Maze Game</h1>

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
<p>You folowed the light ahead of you.</p>
<p>You end up entering a room lit up with torches. As you step inside, there is a loud rumble, and the path behind you collapses with rubble. With no food or water, you end up spending the rest of your days sitting in this cave, until you die.</p>
=======
<p>You took the left iron door.</p>
<p>This door ends up leading you to an old bunker with a radio still intact. You're able to contact someone nearby and they're on the way to help you. </p>

<p>A rescue team eventually digs you out of your underground maze, and gets you some well-earned food and medicine. You're free!</p>
