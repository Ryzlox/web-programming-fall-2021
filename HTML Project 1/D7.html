<h1>Adventure Maze Game</h1>

<p>You took the left iron door.</p>
<p>This door ends up leading you to an old bunker with a radio still intact. You're able to contact someone nearby and they're on the way to help you. </p>

<p>A rescue team eventually digs you out of your underground maze, and gets you some well-earned food and medicine. You're free!</p>

<p>This was a good ending! You won the game! Try again from the start or go back and check out the other endings!</p>
