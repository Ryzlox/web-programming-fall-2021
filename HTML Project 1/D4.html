<p>You get in the water and investigate the hole.</p>
<p>You're able to hold your breath and swim through it, and you rise to the surface. There seems to be an island nearby!</p>
<p> You're able to get on the island, get some fruits, and make a temporary shelter and a signal fire for people to come rescue you.</p>
<p> You eventually are rescued by a rescue team!</p>

<p>This was a good ending! You won the game! Try again from the start or go back and check out the other endings!</p>
