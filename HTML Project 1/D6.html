<p>You unlocked the white door on the right.</p>
<p>The key jams in the keyhole and won't come out. After walking down this hallway, you end up finding yourself stuck at a dead end. Suddenly, water begins to fill the room. </p>
<p>With the only opening being to small to swim through, you have no escape, and drown to death.</p>

<p>This was a bad ending! Try again from the start or go back and check out the other endings!</p>
